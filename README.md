## Prototype Application

This is the foundation of a prototype application, also meant to serve
as an example of node application structure. 

## Note

Prototyping in this for graph/rdbms has begun, which means that this may or may not be subtly broken
at any time, as well as include very weird, very not-production style code.

### Getting started

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm test` for the very, very small test-suite
- Run `npm start` for starting the server
